Advanced Programming Languages course projects.

## About
This repo contains my solutions for the assigments of the Advanced Programming Languages course at NTUA. This course analyzes advanced concepts on the theory and implementation of programming languages, while there is also a focus on functional programming with Haskell.
<br><br>
Specifically the covered topics correspond to the following projects:
<ul>
  <li>An interpreter of the esoteric programming language <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Befunge">Befunge-93</a> written in C++</li>
  <li>A garbage collector for a flavor of Befunge-93 that uses the heap, devised for this course, called <b>Befunge-93+</b></li>
  <li>An introduction to <i>pure</i> and <i>impure</i> <b>Haskell</b>, while solving an algorithmic pool tournament problem</li>
  <li>Using <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck">Quickcheck</a> to random test algorithms on trees</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_inference">Type Inference</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simply_typed_lambda_calculus">Simply typed lambda calculus</a> with Haskell</li>
  <li>Comparison of Parallel and Concurrent approaches with Haskell. Bonus: Quickcheck testcase generator</li>
  <li>An interpreter of an imaginary stack-based language written in Haskell, faithful to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denotational_semantics">Denotational Semantics</a> rules</li>
  <li>A <b>PHP</b> server and a <b>Python</b> client that play a modular arithmetic question answering game</li>
  <li>Validation of a C++ program based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_semantics">Axiomatic Semantics</a>, using <a href="https://frama-c.com/">Frama-C</a></li>
</ul>
